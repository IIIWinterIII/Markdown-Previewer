# **Markdown Previewer**
Welcome to the Markdown Previewer project! This project is developed using HTML, CSS and React, and is a simple web application for viewing and editing Markdown text.

## Functionality
The project is a one-page web application with two windows: an input window and a preview window. You can freely edit the text in the input window, and the converted Markdown text will be instantly displayed at the bottom.
